# Setting up Enthalix

Enthalix is a public preview. It runs on macOS, Windows and Linux, with
EnergyPlus 26.1. It is developed on macOS (Apple silicon); every change is
built and run on all three systems automatically (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`).

You install each part yourself, from its own publisher and under its own terms.
To see what is installed and what is missing, run this in `program/`:

```bash
pnpm setup:check
```

The check only reads; it installs nothing.

## 1. The software

| Part | Where to get it | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Node.js 22 or newer | [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/) | |
| pnpm | [pnpm.io](https://pnpm.io/installation) | or `npm install -g pnpm` |
| git | [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/) | to copy the repository |
| EnergyPlus 26.1 | [EnergyPlus releases](https://github.com/NatLabRockies/EnergyPlus/releases) | Install it with its own installer, in its usual folder (below). To use another installation, set `ENERGYPLUS` to its `energyplus` program. |

Where Enthalix looks for EnergyPlus:

| System | EnergyPlus's download | Where Enthalix looks |
| --- | --- | --- |
| macOS | `…-Darwin-macOS13-arm64.dmg` (Apple silicon) or `…-x86_64.dmg` (Intel) | `/Applications/EnergyPlus-*`, `/usr/local/bin`, `/opt/homebrew/bin` |
| Windows | `…-Windows-x86_64.exe`, or `…-Windows-arm64.exe` on an ARM computer | `C:\EnergyPlusV*` and `Program Files` |
| Linux | `…-Linux-Ubuntu24.04-x86_64.sh` (or `.tar.gz`) | `/usr/local/EnergyPlus-*`, `/opt/EnergyPlus-*`, `/usr/local/bin`, `/usr/bin` |

Then, in a copy of this repository:

```bash
cd program
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

The first `pnpm dev` downloads Electron's binary.

**On Windows**, building from source also needs the Microsoft Visual C++
runtime ([download](https://learn.microsoft.com/cpp/windows/latest-supported-vc-redist));
without it `pnpm dev` and `pnpm build` stop with "The specified module could
not be found". Run the commands in PowerShell or the Command Prompt.

**On Linux**, if Electron will not start because of its sandbox (Ubuntu 23.10 and
later restrict unprivileged user namespaces), start it with
`pnpm exec electron . --no-sandbox` while `pnpm exec vite` runs, or allow the
namespaces as your distribution documents.

### An installer instead

`pnpm dist` builds an installer for the system you run it on, in `release/`: a
`.dmg` on macOS, a setup `.exe` on Windows, an `.AppImage` and a `.deb` on Linux.
They are not code-signed yet: macOS asks you to open the app with right-click ›
Open the first time, and Windows SmartScreen asks you to choose "Run anyway". An
AppImage needs `libfuse2` on recent Ubuntu.

**On Windows on ARM**, use the x64 installer built by the project's checks
(Windows runs it on ARM). An ARM64 installer made with `pnpm dist` on an ARM
computer currently installs without `Enthalix.exe` and its DLLs; the cause is
not yet known.

An installed Enthalix keeps your files in its app-data folder (see "Where your
files are"). It still needs EnergyPlus installed separately.

### Known issue: Windows in Parallels on a Mac

In a Windows virtual machine under Parallels Desktop on Apple silicon, the
EnergyPlus run can stop the whole virtual machine. It happens when EnergyPlus
calculates shadows on the graphics card (SITE › shadows: PixelCounting, the
default), through Parallels' 3D acceleration. Run Enthalix on macOS itself on
such a Mac, or choose PolygonClipping under SITE › shadows (some buildings then
report non-convex surfaces as Severe errors).

## 2. A building

Use BIM › Open IFC… to open an IFC file. To try the program, open the sample
building `samples/Duplex_A_20110907.ifc` (see `samples/README.md` for its source
and licence).

Enthalix reads the rooms (IfcSpace), the walls, slabs, roofs, windows and doors,
and the site's position (IfcSite). A room-based model from an architect's
authoring tool works best.

## 3. Weather

In BEM › SITE, under "weather file", click "Find…". The map shows every location in
EnergyPlus's own weather repository
([energyplus.net/weather](https://energyplus.net/weather)). Click the station
nearest the site, and the app downloads its files into `Weather/`. Some data
sets in that repository have their own licence; the
[sources page](https://energyplus.net/weather/sources) says which.

You can also use "Browse…" to pick any `.epw` file, or put one with its `.ddy`
beside it in `Weather/`.

## 4. The energy code

Enthalix ships the DOE/PNNL residential prototype values for each IECC
edition (2006 to 2024), so a model runs from the start; a project reads the
2021 edition until you choose another. They are the prototypes' values, not a
state's code (see `references/energy-codes/README.md`). To use the code your
project is under as the code states it, enter its values:

1. Read the code; the IECC is free to read at
   [codes.iccsafe.org](https://codes.iccsafe.org/).
2. In BEM › SITE › energy code, click **Choose…**, then **Edit values…**. Give the code an id
   and a name, pick your climate zone's row, and enter each value with the
   table or section it is from. Save writes `data/energy-codes/`; the CSV
   format is in `references/energy-codes/README.md`, if you prefer to edit
   the files directly.
3. Click **Choose…**, choose the edition, enter the climate zone that your
   county's row in the code's table (IECC Table R301.1) states, and click Use.

If a code of your own is missing a value, the model is still built, so you can
set up zones, schedules and systems, but it cannot run, and the app names the
values that are missing.

## 5. Costs and calibration (optional)

- **Tariff:** copy `references/tariffs/tariff.template.json` to
  `data/tariffs/tariff.json` and fill it in from your utility's published rate
  schedule (`references/tariffs/README.md`).
- **Bills and PV:** type your bills in BOM, or import them as CSV, and import
  your PV system's daily production as CSV.
- **Actual-year weather:** for the calibration year, Enthalix builds a weather
  file from the hourly readings of the NOAA station nearest the site, plus the
  sun and sky from the Open-Meteo archive. **Open-Meteo's free API is for
  non-commercial use only.** For paid work, use an actual-year weather file you
  have the right to use, with "Run on my own weather file…" on the calibration
  card.

## Where your files are

| What | Where |
| --- | --- |
| Projects and your decisions | `projects.sqlite` in the app-data folder: `~/Library/Application Support/Enthalix/` on macOS, `%APPDATA%\Enthalix\` on Windows, `~/.config/Enthalix/` on Linux |
| Models, runs and your own tables | `data/` in the repository, never committed; in an installed Enthalix, `data/` in the app-data folder |
| Weather files | `Weather/` in the repository, never committed; in an installed Enthalix, `Weather/` in the app-data folder |
| All of these, elsewhere | set `ENTHALIX_HOME` to a folder, and Enthalix keeps `projects.sqlite`, `data/` and `Weather/` there |
| Settings | `data/settings.json`, for example `{ "geocoderUrl": "https://…/search" }` to use another Nominatim-compatible geocoder |
