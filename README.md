# BIM-BEM-BOM

**Where the model meets the meter.**

BIM-BEM-BOM is open-source building energy modelling software offered by
**Enthalix LLC**. The program is BIM-BEM-BOM; Enthalix is the company. Its
name is its three parts: the building information model (IFC) in, the building
energy model (EnergyPlus) out, and the building operations model, the
building's measured operation compared back against the model.

> **Status: public preview.** Runs on macOS, Windows and Linux, from source or
> from an installer you build (`pnpm dist`), with EnergyPlus 26.1. Developed on
> macOS; every change is built and run on all three systems automatically.
> Results are simulation estimates, not code-compliance documentation.

## What it does

- **BIM** reads a building's IFC model: its rooms, walls, slabs, roofs, windows
  and doors. It reduces each assembly to the single surface EnergyPlus needs,
  and reports anything it can't place.
- **BEM** builds the energy model: site and weather, constructions, schedules,
  zones and systems. It then runs EnergyPlus, which you install separately.
- **BOM** prices the simulated year with your utility's tariff, takes your bills
  and PV production, and calibrates the model against ASHRAE Guideline 14.

## Getting started

See [SETUP.md](SETUP.md). In short: install Node.js, pnpm and EnergyPlus 26.1,
then run `pnpm install` and `pnpm dev` in `program/`, and open the sample
building in [`samples/`](samples/). To see what is installed and what is
missing, run `pnpm setup:check`.

BIM-BEM-BOM ships no copyrighted standards tables, weather files or manufacturer
data. You get each from its publisher, under its own terms; SETUP.md says where.
For the energy code it ships public-domain reference values: those of the
DOE/PNNL residential prototype models, for each IECC edition from 2006 to 2024.
With them, a model runs before you enter your own code.

For how the program is built, see [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md).

## Who it's for

Researchers, engineers, architects and anyone else interested in practical,
honest building energy modelling. Early users are invited to try the preview,
report what works and what doesn't, and help shape where it goes next.
