# Energy code values

Enthalix reads the prescriptive values of the energy code your project is under:
the envelope U-factors, the window SHGC, slab insulation, air leakage and the
reference thermostat.

**What ships with Enthalix:** the values of the DOE/PNNL Residential Prototype
Building Models ([energycodes.gov](https://www.energycodes.gov/prototype-building-models)),
for each IECC edition from 2006 to 2024 and each climate zone, in
`program/src/modules/bem/reference/`. They are public domain, and DOE and PNNL are
acknowledged in the app (hover on the code's name under BEM › SITE › energy code). A project with no table
of your own reads the 2021 edition. Each value cites the prototype file it was
read from; `program/scripts/pnnl-codes/` re-reads them.

They are the prototypes' values, not the code's own tables. The windows,
skylights, slab, air leakage and thermostat are the requirements the prototypes
state. The wall, ceiling, floor and basement-wall U-factors are what EnergyPlus
computed for the prototypes' assemblies, which are built to the code's
insulation R-values. They can differ from the code's U-factor table. For
example, the basement wall in zones 4 to 7 is built to R-13 or R-19 cavity
insulation and reads U 0.087 or 0.063, where the code's U-factor table
states 0.059 or 0.050.

**Your own code's values:** each code belongs to its publisher, so its own
tables do not ship. The IECC is free to read online, read-only, at
[codes.iccsafe.org](https://codes.iccsafe.org/). Many states also publish the
code they adopted. Enter the values as described below. A table of your own is
read before the shipped values.

If a value the model needs is missing from your table, the model is still
built, but it cannot run; the app names the missing value. Enthalix never invents a value.

## Setting up

The simplest way is in the app: BEM › SITE › energy code › **Choose…** › **Edit values…**
writes these files for you, one climate zone's row at a time, and keeps the
file it replaces beside it as a `.bak`. To edit the files directly instead:

1. Create the folder `data/energy-codes/` in the repository and copy the four
   CSV files from this folder into it. `data/` holds your own files and is never
   committed.
2. In `editions.csv`, add one row for each code edition you use, for example
   `IECC-2021,2021 IECC,IECC-2021,International Code Council,,<the page you read>,<date>,<what you read>`.
3. In `values.csv`, add one row for each edition, zone and factor (see the
   tables below). Every row needs its `unit` and its `cite` (the table or
   section); a row without them is refused.
4. `state-adoptions.csv` and `state-overrides.csv` are optional. Use them to list
   a state's adoptions with their dates, and the values a state amended.
5. Start Enthalix. In BEM › SITE, open the energy code, choose the edition, enter
   the climate zone that your county's row in the code's climate-zone table
   states (IECC Table R301.1), and click Use.

## Factors

| factor | unit | zone column | what it is |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `fenestrationU` | Btu/h·ft²·°F | zone number | window U-factor |
| `skylightU` | Btu/h·ft²·°F | zone number | skylight U-factor |
| `ceilingU` | Btu/h·ft²·°F | zone number | ceiling U-factor |
| `frameWallU` | Btu/h·ft²·°F | zone number | wood frame wall U-factor |
| `massWallU` | Btu/h·ft²·°F | zone number | mass wall U-factor |
| `floorU` | Btu/h·ft²·°F | zone number | floor U-factor |
| `basementWallU` | Btu/h·ft²·°F | zone number | basement wall U-factor |
| `crawlWallU` | Btu/h·ft²·°F | zone number | crawl space wall U-factor |
| `fenestrationSHGC` | `-` | zone number | glazed fenestration SHGC; leave `value` empty where the code says NR |
| `slabR` | h·ft²·°F/Btu | zone number | slab edge insulation R-value (0 if none required) |
| `slabDepthFt` | ft | zone number | slab insulation depth (0 where no slab insulation is required) |
| `ach50` | ACH50 | zone number, or `all` | air leakage limit |
| `heatingSetpointF` | °F | `all` | standard reference design heating thermostat |
| `coolingSetpointF` | °F | `all` | standard reference design cooling thermostat |

A zone row is keyed by the zone number (`4`, not `4A`). For example, where the
code's table has one row for "5 and Marine 4", enter it as zone `5`; Enthalix
reads Marine 4 from it.
