### Compiled into web-ifc's WebAssembly

web-ifc's build (release 0.77) compiles these libraries into its WebAssembly
files.

## Data included in the application

| Data | Source | Terms | How Enthalix uses it |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Residential energy-code values by IECC edition (2006–2024) and climate zone: `program/src/modules/bem/reference/pnnl-*.csv` | The Residential Prototype Building Models developed by Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) for the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), [energycodes.gov](https://www.energycodes.gov/prototype-building-models) | DOE publishes the information on its websites as public domain and asks that DOE be acknowledged in any later use ([energy.gov/web-policies](https://www.energy.gov/web-policies)). Enthalix acknowledges DOE and PNNL here and in the app, under BEM › SITE › energy code. DOE and PNNL do not endorse Enthalix. | The default values when no energy-code table of the user's own is on record. The window, skylight, slab, air-leakage and thermostat values are those the prototypes state. The wall, ceiling, floor and basement-wall U-factors are those EnergyPlus computed for the prototypes' assemblies. Each value cites the prototype file it was read from. `program/scripts/pnnl-codes/` re-reads them from the published files. |

The prototypes model codes as published. They are not a state's adopted code.

## The application runtime

| Component | Version | Licence | How Enthalix uses it |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [Electron](https://github.com/electron/electron) | 44.1.0 | MIT | The desktop application. Electron includes Chromium, V8, Node.js, FFmpeg and other components. Their licences are listed in `LICENSES.chromium.html`, which comes with every Electron build. FFmpeg is LGPL-2.1-or-later and is included as a separate, replaceable library (`libffmpeg`). |

## Programs Enthalix runs but does not include

| Component | Licence | How Enthalix uses it |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [EnergyPlus](https://github.com/NatLabRockies/EnergyPlus) | EnergyPlus licence (BSD-3-Clause-style, with a clause on the use of the EnergyPlus name) | The simulation engine. The user installs it, and Enthalix runs it as its own program. Enthalix reads the schema (`Energy+.idd` and `Energy+.schema.epJSON`), the `DataSets`, an example file and the `WeatherData` folder from that installation. "EnergyPlus" is a trademark of the US Department of Energy. Enthalix is not affiliated with or endorsed by the Department of Energy. |
| unzip ([Info-ZIP](https://infozip.sourceforge.net/)) | Info-ZIP licence | The operating system's own `unzip` unpacks downloaded weather archives. |

## Data and web services used at run time

Nothing from these sources is shipped with Enthalix. The application contacts
them while it runs.
