        <section>
          <h2>Purpose</h2>
          <p>Turns a building's IFC model into an EnergyPlus energy model, runs it, and compares its results — priced by your utility's own
            tariff — with the building's metered bills and its measured solar production.</p>
          <h2>Intended users</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Energy modelers and mechanical engineers building EnergyPlus models from an architect's IFC file</li>
            <li>Architects and designers checking an envelope's energy performance against the energy code</li>
            <li>Researchers, students and building owners comparing a model with utility bills and PV production</li>
          </ul>
        </section>

          <h2>Overview</h2>
          <h3>Organization</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>One window: the module rail at the far left (BIM · BEM · BOM); beside it the LEVELS · SPACES column, listing the building's
              levels and their spaces, to the left of the main view; the view in the centre, a frame of cards under it, and the selected
              module's tabs and details in the right column</li>
            <li><b>BIM</b> reads the IFC and collapses each assembly to the single plane EnergyPlus takes, carved by room → <code>idf.db</code></li>
            <li><b>BEM</b> builds the energy model — site and weather, constructions, schedules, zones, systems — and runs EnergyPlus → <code>bem.db</code></li>
            <li><b>BOM</b> prices the run by your tariff, takes your bills and PV production, and runs the calibration year → <code>bom.db</code></li>
            <li>Each module reads the file before it; every derived file carries the hash of what it was built from, so a stale result is
              marked. Your decisions are kept in ledgers tied to the IFC file and saved as you work</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>What you provide</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>The building's IFC file, and IFC files beside it for the site's terrain and shading</li>
            <li>EnergyPlus, installed separately — run <code>pnpm setup:check</code> to see what is installed and what is missing (SETUP.md)</li>
            <li>A weather file from EnergyPlus's weather repository (picked on the map in BEM › SITE), or one you obtained</li>
            <li>The energy code your project is under: its climate zone for your county and its values, read from the code's own text
              (free to read at codes.iccsafe.org) — no code table ships with Enthalix</li>
            <li>Materials: EnergyPlus's datasets, the openstudio-standards catalogue, and your own entries</li>
            <li>Your utility's tariff, transcribed from its published schedule; your bills (typed or CSV) and a PV production export</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Limitations</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>The program reads what the file states and derives nothing: where the file is silent a code default governs and is
              labeled as one, and geometry it cannot merge is reported, never repaired in silence</li>
            <li>Results are simulation estimates — not a guarantee of energy use or cost, and not code-compliance documentation</li>
            <li>Calibration follows ASHRAE Guideline 14's statistics; a typical-year run cannot calibrate, and the actual year's sun is an
              estimate checked against the measured PV</li>
            <li>The tariff arithmetic covers a residential schedule with net metering (see references/tariffs/README.md)</li>
            <li>A public preview: developed and tested on macOS, on few buildings</li>
          </ul>
