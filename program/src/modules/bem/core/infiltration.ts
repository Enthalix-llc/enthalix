// A ZONE'S INFILTRATION FROM ITS BLOWER-DOOR NUMBER (user, 2026-10-08: "build it into Zones" — the house must test under
// 5 ACH50, "expected infiltration is almost nothing … the garage will see higher than the house"). Two rulings a Zone card
// can carry on ZONES, the one place they are typed:
//   · ACH50 → EnergyPlus's ZoneInfiltration:EffectiveLeakageArea (the Sherman-Grimsrud model): the leakage at 50 Pa turned
//     into the effective leakage area at 4 Pa, the flow then driven hour by hour by the indoor-outdoor ΔT (stack) and the
//     wind — low on a mild calm day, higher on a cold windy one;
//   · a constant ACH → ZoneInfiltration:DesignFlowRate as the code default is written (the garage's door openings).
// Measured 2026-10-08 (EnergyPlus 26.1, the user's model): an EffectiveLeakageArea named for a ZONE is shared among the
// zone's spaces — 100 cm² on the zone gave the same flow as 100 cm² on one of its spaces (0.01009 m³/s both) — so one
// object per zone carries the zone's whole leakage area.
