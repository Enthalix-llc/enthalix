// (x, y, z) Z-up and web-ifc maps it to (x, z, -y); EnergyPlus is Z-up, so
// the way back is X = x, Y = -z, Z = y — a proper rotation, so winding is
// preserved. The engine takes the winding AS the outward normal (a reversed
// ring puts the sun on the wrong side and says nothing), so every ring is
// oriented here about the zone's OUTWARD normal and then asserted by Newell.
