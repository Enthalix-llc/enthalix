// THE TARIFF (user, 2026-10-03: "BOM main view should show the energyplus results with utility costs included in both energyplus

// template references/tariffs/tariff.template.json): every number with the schedule, section and URL it was read from;
// a number without its citation is refused. One arithmetic prices a month of the run and a month of the bills alike:
//
//   net = kWh in − kWh out (the meter's delivered minus received)
//   net > 0: credits banked earlier are applied first; the rest is billed — delivery and supply per kWh, the PCA per kWh, the
//            demand charge on the month's billing demand
//   net ≤ 0: a billing-period credit — only the non-usage-sensitive charge (the access charge) is paid; −net kWh are banked
//   end of a 12-month net metering period: the bank carries into the next period only up to the period's billed consumption
//            (less the credits carried in and applied); the rest is not compensated (no purchase agreement — the user's ruling)
//
// The PCA (power cost adjustment) is NOT in the schedule: typed from a bill, or the line says it is missing and the total leaves it
// out. A demand the month did not state (a bill without kW) is said, never assumed.
